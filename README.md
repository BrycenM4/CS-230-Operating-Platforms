# CS-230-Operating-Platforms
This a project I did for my CS-230 Operating Platforms course through SNHU. In this project, I help design a web-based videogame called "Draw It or Lose It," where I created UML diagrams, evaluated requirements for developing applications on different platforms, and gave my reccomendations for how I would go about developing this program.

# Questions
- Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
 The client "The Gaming Room," has a game called "Draw It or Lose it," which is already available on Andriod devices, but they want to develop a web-based application for it, as well as an iOS version. The game should be able to hold multiple teams, with each team having multiple members. There will be four rounds in total, with each lasting a minute each, and the objective is for a team to guess what the puzzle is, and if they fail to guess before the time is up, then another team has a chance to guess.

- What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
    I think I did well on explaining the requirements and pros/cons for each development platform, by making sure each section was detailed enough for the audience to get a good grasp of what each platform would be like in a development environment.

- What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
    Working through the design document while developing the code allowed me to get a better understanding of how the application should ultimately look and feel. I would say figuring out the design constraints were the most helpful towards developing the code, because those really laid out the important aspects of what the program needs to be able to do, which I was able to apply to my code and help it become succesful.

- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    If I could go back and revise anything, it would definitely be my explanation of the domain model, because my description of that and how it worked was pretty much a jumbled mess. Even I have some trouble understanding it now that I'm looking back on it. I would probaboly break that down into paragraphs and try to explain it in a simpler way.

- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    To interpret and implement the users needs into the design of this application, I tried to put myself into their shoes, and imagine I'm using the program from their perspective. This is a super important step when designing software because they're the ones that will ultimately be using this program on a daily basis, so it needs to be what makes sense for them, not for us as developers.

- How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
    I try to approach designing software in a simple, big picture type of way. Instead of worrying about the small details, I try to just get a overview of how the application should look and feel, and from there I can worry about smaller things later on in the process. A strategy that I will defintely use in the future is to simply go look at other game like it that are succesful. If you can find our what makes their program succesful, then you can apply it to yours, and then tweak it to make it even better.
